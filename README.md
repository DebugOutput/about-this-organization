## Purpose

This organization will be used for Philips Internal repositories.

<a name="who"></a>
## Who should use this?

Currently we're running a GitHub Pilot to see how we can use GitHub for our code repositories within Philips.

<a name="join"></a>
## Can I join this Pilot?

Although it's still a pilot, we definitively want more people to join.
Send an email to: @jeroenknoops with some short motivation and we will add you.

<a name="public"></a>
## Why is this repo public?

This repository is public, so people who want to join the Pilot can find it. The rest of the repositories will be either: *Internal* or *Private*

## Status
GitHub Pilot status: *testing*
