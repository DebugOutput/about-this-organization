# Philips - Internal 

## Purpose

This organization will be used for Philips Internal repositories.

## Who should use this?

Currently we're running a GitHub Pilot to see how we can use GitHub for our code repositories within Philips.

## Can I join this Pilot?

Although it's still a pilot, we definitively want more people to join.
Send an email to: @jeroenknoops with some short motivation and we will add you.

## Status

GitHub Pilot status: *testing*
